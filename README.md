# 🔍 CTF Collection - Digital Forensics & Incident Response
Welcome to my comprehensive collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges focused on cybersecurity, digital forensics, and incident response. 
This repository contains practical exercises designed to enhance understanding of Linux security, file permissions, system administration, and threat detection.

### Overview
This collection features hands-on challenges that simulate real-world scenarios encountered in:

Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

Linux System Administration

Cybersecurity Analysis

Penetration Testing

Security Auditing

-> You can extract [copy-paste] Challenge Questions and perform for yourselves.

-> Read how I did it and documented it.

-> Share your documention and kick-start your journey in DFIR | Cybersecurity
